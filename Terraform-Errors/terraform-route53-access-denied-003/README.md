# Terraform AWS Route 53 Error: Access Denied to Hosted Zone

## üóìÔ∏è Date Encountered: June 20, 2025
## üè∑Ô∏è Category: Terraform, AWS Route 53, IAM

---

## üßê The Problem I Faced

I was attempting to provision multiple EC2 instances and create corresponding A records in AWS Route 53 for a new environment. When running `terraform apply`, the EC2 instances created successfully, but the creation of the Route 53 records failed with an "Access Denied" error for the hosted zone.

This indicated that my IAM user (`pandu-cli`) lacked the necessary permissions to interact with the specified Route 53 Hosted Zone, or that the Hosted Zone ID itself was incorrect, leading to an attempt to access a non-existent or unauthorized resource.

## ü§Ø The Exact Error Message

When I ran `terraform apply -auto-approve`, after the EC2 instances were provisioned, I received multiple errors similar to this:

‚ï∑
‚îÇ Error: reading Route 53 Hosted Zone (Z032558618100M4EJX8X4): operation error Route 53: GetHostedZone, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: 0ceb52f6-dbaf-4e5c-a241-4fbd35ed4feb, api error AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:iam::351818465616:user/pandu-cli is not authorized to access this resource

*(There were similar errors for `aws_route53_record.www[1]`, `[2]`, and `[3]` as well.)*

## üìú Relevant Code Snippets (Before Fix)

The relevant part of my Terraform configuration was the `aws_route53_record` resource, which was referencing a `zone_id`:

```terraform
# Example of the resource attempting to be created
resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  # ... other attributes
  name    = "mongodb.daws84s.site" # Example name
  type    = "A"
  zone_id = "Z032558618100M4EJX8X4" # <-- The problematic Hosted Zone ID
  # ... other attributes
}
(Note: The zone_id was likely defined via a variable, e.g., var.route53_hosted_zone_id)

ü§î My Initial Thoughts & Misconceptions
My first thought was that my IAM user (pandu-cli) simply didn't have the route53:GetHostedZone permission. I considered attaching a more permissive policy. However, the exact Hosted Zone ID (Z032558618100M4EJX8X4) also caught my attention. It might have been a typo, or I was trying to manage a Hosted Zone that either didn't exist or belonged to a different AWS account where my user truly had no access.

üî¨ Troubleshooting Steps I Took
Ran terraform apply and observed the detailed error message, specifically noting the AccessDenied and GetHostedZone actions for the specified Hosted Zone ID.
Confirmed the IAM user pandu-cli had the necessary route53:* or at least route53:GetHostedZone permissions. It turned out the permissions were generally sufficient.
Cross-checked the zone_id in my Terraform variables/configuration against the actual Hosted Zone ID in the AWS Route 53 console for daws84s.site. This is where I found the discrepancy. The ID I was using was either incorrect or from a different context.
üí° The Root Cause
The root cause was an incorrect Hosted Zone ID being used in the aws_route53_record resource's zone_id attribute (likely passed via a variable). Even with correct IAM permissions for Route 53, if the specific resource (the Hosted Zone identified by that ID) doesn't exist or isn't accessible to your account/user, you will get an AccessDenied error. In this case, the zone_id Z032558618100M4EJX8X4 was not the correct or accessible ID for the domain I was working with.

‚úÖ The Step-by-Step Solution
The solution was to update the route53_hosted_zone_id variable (or directly in the configuration if it wasn't a variable) with the correct and valid Hosted Zone ID from my AWS account for the daws84s.site domain.

Obtained the correct Hosted Zone ID:
Navigated to the Route 53 service in the AWS Management Console.
Selected "Hosted zones" from the left navigation.
Found the daws84s.site hosted zone and copied its Hosted Zone ID.
Updated my Terraform variables file (or r53.tf directly):
Terraform

# Example variable definition
variable "route53_hosted_zone_id" {
  description = "The Hosted Zone ID for daws84s.site"
  type        = string
  default     = "Z0XXXXX18100XXXX" # Replaced with the correct ID
}
Or, if directly in the resource:
Terraform

resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  # ...
  zone_id = "Z0XXXXX18100XXXX" # Replaced with the correct ID
  # ...
}
Re-ran terraform apply -auto-approve: The plan showed the Route 53 records being created, and the apply completed successfully without any access denied errors.
üéì What I Learned (Key Takeaways)
Validate Resource IDs: Always double-check and validate resource IDs (like Hosted Zone IDs, VPC IDs, Subnet IDs) you are referencing in Terraform, especially when copying them or using them in new contexts. A seemingly "access denied" error might actually be due to referencing a non-existent or inaccessible resource.
Permissions vs. Resource Existence: An AccessDenied error can mean insufficient IAM permissions, but it can also mean you're trying to access a resource that doesn't exist or is in a different account. Always confirm both the permissions AND the resource's validity.
GetHostedZone Action: The error specifically mentioned GetHostedZone, indicating Terraform's initial step was to retrieve information about the hosted zone before creating records. This helps pinpoint where the authorization failed.

--- Solution Applied ---
Updated the 'route53_hosted_zone_id' variable (or direct zone_id in r53.tf)
with the correct Hosted Zone ID for 'daws84s.site' obtained from AWS Console.
--- Verification After Fix ---
Assuming a successful 'terraform apply' was run after the fix.
The output would typically show all resources created or updated.
(No output provided, but this is the expected result.)
