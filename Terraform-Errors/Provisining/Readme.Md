# üöß Terraform Provisioning Errors & Resolutions Guide

This document tracks the common provisioning errors encountered during a Terraform project and how they were resolved. It includes syntax issues, misconfigurations, and state locking problems while using AWS, `aws_instance` resources, remote backends (S3 & DynamoDB), and provisioners.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error 1: Unclosed Configuration Block

**Error Message:**
```bash
Error: Unclosed configuration block
on ec2.tf line 1, in resource "aws_instance" "roboshop":
1: resource "aws_instance" "roboshop" {
Root Cause:
The resource block was missing a closing brace (}).

Resolution:
Add the missing closing brace at the end of your resource:

hcl
Copy
Edit
provisioner "local-exec" {
  command = "echo ${self.private_ip} > iventory"
}
}  # ‚Üê This was missing
‚ö†Ô∏è Error 2: Attribute Redefined
Error Message:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: Attribute redefined
on ec2.tf line 16, in resource "aws_instance" "roboshop":
16: command = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
Root Cause:
The command argument was defined more than once within the same provisioner block.

Resolution:
Separate the two local-exec provisioners properly:

hcl
Copy
Edit
provisioner "local-exec" {
  command     = "echo ${self.private_ip} > iventory"
  on_failure  = continue
}

provisioner "local-exec" {
  when        = destroy
  command     = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
  on_failure  = continue
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Error 3: Invalid Expression in Inline Block
Error Message:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: Invalid expression
on ec2.tf line 37, in resource "aws_instance" "roboshop":
37:     inline =
38:     [
Root Cause:
A remote-exec block was not closed before another started, resulting in broken syntax.

Resolution:
Ensure proper brace closure between provisioner blocks:

hcl
Copy
Edit
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo dnf install nginx -y",
    "sudo systemctl start nginx"
  ]
}

provisioner "remote-exec" {
  when = destroy
  inline = [
    "systemctl stop nginx"
  ]
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Error 4: State Lock - PreconditionFailed (HTTP 412)
Error Message:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
Error message: operation error S3: PutObject, https response error StatusCode: 412
api error PreconditionFailed: At least one of the pre-conditions you specified did not hold
Root Cause:
Another process or user modified the Terraform state file in S3 between read and write operations. Terraform enforces optimistic locking to avoid corruption.

üîç Analysis:
Lock Info helps identify who/what is holding the lock.

It‚Äôs usually triggered by:

Simultaneous Terraform operations.

CI/CD interference.

A stale lock after an interrupted process.

‚úÖ Resolutions:
‚úÖ Option 1: Wait & Retry
Let the current lock expire or wait until the other process finishes.

‚úÖ Option 2: Force Unlock (Use with caution!)
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
Only use if you're absolutely sure no active Terraform command is running.

‚úÖ Option 3: Clean Up State
If you're trying to modify variables but old resources are still present:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform state rm 'aws_instance.roboshop["mongodb"]'
terraform state rm 'aws_instance.roboshop["redis"]'
Then rerun:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
terraform apply
üß† Key Learnings
Terraform syntax is strict ‚Äî always match opening and closing braces.

Each block (e.g., provisioner, inline) must be complete before starting a new one.

Backend locking via S3/DynamoDB ensures consistency but can cause issues if not handled carefully.

terraform state commands are powerful tools to realign your state with real infrastructure.

üìÅ Structure Reminder
Double-check that:

Your backend block is in the correct file (main.tf or backend.tf)

The .terraform.lock.hcl is clean and valid

You're not duplicating attribute names inside any resource or block

‚úÖ Suggested Improvements
Add syntax linting via tflint or terraform validate to catch issues early

Automate cleanup of stale locks in dev environments

Version-control changes to state-sensitive files carefully
